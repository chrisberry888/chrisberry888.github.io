    "The four major American sports leagues (MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL) have very long and extensive histories, and established throughout each league's history were traditions and \"common knowledge\" that many managers and front offices adhere to, to this day. However, many of the rules and practices that teams follow simply do not match up with what they mathematically <i>should</i> be doing. \n",
    "\n",
    "The goal of every sports team should be to win games, and so every decision made by a coach should be made with the intention of increasing the probability that that team will win the game. For example, if a football coach thinks that kicking an onside kick will make them more likely to win the game, then they should choose to kick an onside kick. Despite this, there are many decisions that coaches make that are made because of deep-rooted traditions in the sport, without considering the data whatsoever. One of the most famous examples of this is punting in football: conventional wisdom states that football teams should almost never go for it on 4th down, but many different sources show that punting is almost never the mathematically correct decision (https://www.footballstudyhall.com/2013/11/15/5105958/fourth-down-pulaski-academy-kevin-kelley#:~:text=Kevin%20Kelley%2C%20Pulaski's%20coach%20never,attempts%20onside%20kicks%20after%20scoring). \n",

    "In this tutorial I will discuss the ways in which win probability is used and misused in the MLB, NFL, NBA, and NHL. In doing so, I will walk through all the steps of analyzing data, from retreiving, cleaning, and processing the data to creating predictive models of different real-life scenareos."

    "Part 1: Expected Value and the 2015-16 Golden State Warriors\n",
    "\n",
    "Before we talk about win probability, we need to talk about a concept called \"expected value\". In the context of sports, expected value (EV) is a measure of how many points that you can expect will result from a decision. The equation for EV is (equation). For example, say we are playing a game, where whenever I flip a coin, if it lands on heads, I give you $10, and if it lands on tails, you give me $5. The equation for EV in this situation is EV = .5*($10) + .5*(-$5) = $2.5; therefore, you can \"expect\" to win $2.50 every time I flip the coin. \n",
    "\n",
    "As another example, take Steve Nash: in the 2005-06 season, Nash made 54.8\\% of his 2-point shots, and 43.9\\% of his 3-point shots. For that season, his expected value of making a 2-point shot was .548*(2) = 1.096 points, and his expected value of making a 3-point shot was .439*(3) = 1.317 points. This means that, with everything else being equal, a 3-point attempt from Nash was worth about 0.221 points more valuable than a 2-point attempt. Despite this, he attempted 9.0 2-point shots per game that season, while only attempting 4.3 3-point shots per game. If a 3-point shot was worth more than a 2-point shot, why didn't he shoot more 3's? One answer is because, in the 2000s, the 3-pointer was considered a bad shot. Many players and coaches believed that it was a losing strategy to shoot more 3-pointers than 2-pointers, in part because that's not a strategy that had ever worked well enough to win a team a championship. That all changed after Stephen Curry proved just how effective 3's could be.\n",
    "\n",
    "In the 2015-16 season, Steph shot 45.4% from 3-point range and 56.6% from 2 point range, meaning that his EV for 2-pointers and 3-pointers were 1.132 and 1.362 points per shot, respectively. However, Curry had 11.2 3-point attempts per game, compared to 9.0 2-point attempts. This was one reason why his Golden State Warriors won a record 73 games that season, and one reason why he recieved every single first-place MVP vote that season. This shows that expected value plays a major role in the success of a sports team.\n",
    "\n",
    "While choosing the higher EV decision doesn't always lead to a higher win probability (more on that later), due to basketball's high scoring volume and high number of possessions per game, always taking high EV shots will almost always lead to a team winning. Steph's 2015-16 MVP season was a wake-up call for the entire NBA; would shooting higher-EV shots lead to more success?\n",

    "Imagine a hockey game between the Boston Bruins and the New York Rangers: there are  2 minutes left in the game, and the Bruins are losing 2-3. The Bruins decide to substitute their goalie for another skater. Andrew Thomas of Harvard University analyzed data from all NHL games between 2003 and 2007 and found that, in games where a goalie was pulled, the winning team scored on the empty net 34% of the time, while the team with the extra skater scored 30% of the time (https://fliphtml5.com/snvq/xptx/basic). So if the Rangers and Bruins are evenly matched, then the Bruins' expected value of pulling the goalie is EV = .3 * (1) + .34 * (-1) = -.04. \n",

    "If the Bruins get negative EV from pulling the goalie, then why do they do it? The answer is because they don't care whether they lose by 1 or lose by 2: they just want to tie the game. Despite being a negative EV decision, deciding to pull the goalie increases the Bruins' chances of winning the game. It would be terribly stupid to pull the goalie while the score is still 0-0 in the first period, but it becomes the smart thing to do if you're losing in the third. This begs the question: when should a team decide to pull their goalie?\n",

Goalies are the only players in hockey who stay on the ice for more than just a minute or so at a time. All goalies start their shift at the beginning of the third period (2400 seconds into the game), and given that the longest shift in NHL history is around 310 seconds, we can safely say that if a shift starts at time marker 2400 and ends beyond 2710, then it's a goalie's shift.\n",

    "At this point, we have enough data to do some simple analysis. But what other factors might be able to predict the losing team's ability to score? Well, if the losing team is usually pretty good on offense, then clearly they will be more likely to come back. Likewise, if the winning team is usually pretty good on defense, then they will be less likely to come back. Because of this, we should calculate how good each losing team's offense is, as well as how good each winning team's defense is. How can we quantify this? One way of quantifying a team's offense is by using their Goals Per Game (GPG), which is the average number of goals that team scores in a game on average. A way of quantifying a team's defense is by using their goalie's Goals Against Average (GAA), which is the average number of goals that they allow per game on average."

This includes every time a team was losing at the end of the game, but it also included every time a goalie left the ice on a delayed penalty, and every time there was a mid-period goalie change. These inaccurate data points will make our findings less accurate, but it certainly doesn't explain the above discrepency.
