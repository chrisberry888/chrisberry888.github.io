This is my final project for CMSC320: Introduction to Data Science. I analyzed the win probability and expected value calculations involved with pulling the goalie at the end of a hockey game. The coolest thing that I found was that if an NHL team is down by one goal, they should pull the goalie with 5 minutes left in the third instead of with two minutes left, which is the league average.

The analysis is hosted on the above github-pages website; if you'd like to see my work, go to the above URL.
